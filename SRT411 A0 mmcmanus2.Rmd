This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Hello, welcome to my webpage. The name of my github account is mmcmanus2.

This document/webpage is for my Assignment 0. For this assignment I have to follow a pdf called A (very) short introduction to R. There are 14 Todos in this assignment and I have attempted all of them plus an additional todo in the footnote of the last one. 

The document called A very short introduction to R can be found here at this link:   <https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf>

Other documents and webpages I used can be found here:

#Todo 2
Age <- (2014-1995)
UniTime <- (2014-2013)

```{r}
#Todo 6

plot(Randnum)
```

```{r}
#Todo 7
P <- seq(from= 31, to = 60, by = 1)
Q <- matrix(P, nrow = 6, ncol =  5)

```{r}
#Todo 8
x1 <- c(rnorm(100))
x2 <- c(rnorm(100))
x3 <- c(rnorm(100))
t <- data.frame(a = x1, b = x1 + x2, c = x1 + x2 + x3)
plot(t)
#sd(t) #This line causes an error
```

```{r}
#Todo 9
x1 <- c(rnorm(100))
x2 <- c(rnorm(100))
x3 <- c(rnorm(100))
t <- data.frame(a = x1, b = x1 + x2, c = x1 + x2 + x3)
plot(t)
#sd(t)
plot(t$a, type="l", ylim=range(t), lwd=3, col=rgb(1,0,0,0.3)) # These next few lines change the graphical parts of the plot. For example the colours changed, line type, the dot/point size and style. 
lines(t$b, type="s", lwd=2, col=rgb(0.3,0.4,0.3,0.9))
points(t$c, pch=20, cex=4, col=rgb(0,0,1,0.3))
#If you want to make plot symbols larger or smaller, you can use the parameter cex. This parameter tells R how much to scale the points up (or down). For example, cex=2 would make the points twice as large, and cex=0.5 would make them half as small.
#You can change the symbols that are plotted at each point by using the parameter pch. There are 19 possible symbols, and they are numbered from 0 to 18. 
#For the parameterlwd it is for line width relative to the default (default=1). 2 is twice as wide.
#The RGB parameter allows you to change the colour for the graph.

```
